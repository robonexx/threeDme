# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Rhubarb Lip Sync

 Rhubarb Lip Sync allows you to quickly create 2D mouth animation from voice recordings. It analyzes your audio files, recognizes what is being said, then automatically generates lip sync information. You can use it for animating speech in computer games, animated cartoons, or any similar project.

Rhubarb Lip Sync integrates with the following applications:

Adobe After Effects (see below)

Moho and OpenToonz (see below)

Spine by Esoteric Software (see below)

Vegas Pro by Magix (see below)

Visionaire Studio (see external link)

In addition, you can use Rhubarb Lip Syncâ€™s command line interface (CLI) to generate files in various output formats (TSV/XML/JSON).
